                    The Viking Torture
                </h2>
                <p>The blood eagle is a ritual method of execution, detailed in late skaldic poetry. According to the two instances mentioned in the Sagas, the victims (in both cases members of royal families) were placed in a prone position, their ribs
                    severed from the spine with a sharp tool, and their lungs pulled through the opening to create a pair of "wings". There is continuing debate about whether the rite was a literary invention, a mistranslation of the original texts, or
                    an authentic historic practice.</p>

                    <p>In Þáttr af Ragnars sonum (the "Tale of Ragnar's sons"), Ivar the Boneless has captured king Ælla of Northumbria, who had killed Ivar's father Ragnar Loðbrók. The killing of Ælla, after a battle for control of <b> York </b>, is described
                        thus: They caused the bloody eagle to be carved on the back of Ælla, and they cut away all of the ribs from the spine, and then they ripped out his lungs.<i> The blood eagle is referred to by the 11th-century poet Sigvatr Þórðarson, who,
                            some time between 1020 and 1038, wrote a skaldic verse named Knútsdrápa</i> that recounts and establishes Ivar the Boneless as having killed Ælla and subsequently cutting his back.

                    <p>There is debate about whether the blood eagle was historically practiced, or whether it was a literary device invented by the authors who transcribed the sagas. No contemporary accounts of the rite exist, and the scant references in
                        the sagas are several hundred years after the Christianization of Scandinavia.</p>
